        - One is a wire armature. Which is what it sounds like. It's skeleton is made up of twisted wire. It has it pros and cons to it. It is very flexable, but it can break easily due to over bending the wire. which causes the wire to break. They are good for short stop motion claymation projects.

        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td width="300">- The last one is a mixture of both. This one is used by many professionals. They were used in films like Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride. It's skeleton is a ball and socket armature with hands made of wire. It gives the puppet more realistic movements. The thing with this one is that have to make replaceable hands because they tend to break easily. </td>

So you can where everything is going to be. You might have to ajust the size of your armature's arms, legs and waist according to what size you want your puppet.</td>

          <p>note: you could also just buy a kit online to make an armature. Unless it is something very elaborate like a dragon.</p>
