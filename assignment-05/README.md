- head can have 5 and the body can have 2.
  The head Element hold the information of the web site but it does not show. The body elements show what the user sees on a web page.

- Structual markup embeds information about the stucture of the document. Semantic markup is used to emphasises workd and phrases.

-I first found a recipe. Then I wrote the main tags. I wrote in the meta tags in the heading. I put in the heading in the body tag. I copied and pasted the recipe and turned it into both an unordered and ordered list. Then I put a photo in using the img scr tag. I pun in the Website to the recipe by using the a href tag. Then I used the same tag that I used for the website but I added a mailto: to the begining of it so I could link my email it the web page. then I use the address tag to add the UM address. I also commented in the code using a HTML comment. That is pretty much it. I also had to commit it to the github and get the links so I can turn it in.
