    <p>
    <p>One Sunday a man arrived</p>
    <p> to sell black water</p>
    <p>that glistened like a riverstone.</p>
    <p>A lady bought some</p>
    <p>and said:</p>
    <p>‘It’s as sweet as heaven’s water must be.’</p>
    <p>They called it iya maskoria – water of mercy.</p>
    <p>To consecrate their tongues,</p>
    <p>some asked for a barter.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t possible.</p>
    <p>They asked why,</p>
    <p>‘It’s called Pepsi Cola,’ said the man.</p>
    <p>We started to drink</p>
    <p>from that death, which shrivels up our skin and makes our blood toothsome.</p>
    <p>Now not even doctors’ water can heal us</p>
    </p>
