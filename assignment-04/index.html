    <h1>Pepsi Cola</h1>
    <h3>By: Hubert Matiúwàa
        Translated: Juana Adcock</h3>
    <p>One Sunday a man arrived
      to sell black water
      that glistened like a riverstone.
      A lady bought some
      and said:
      ‘It’s as sweet as heaven’s water must be.’
      They called it iya maskoria – water of mercy.
      To consecrate their tongues,
      some asked for a barter.
      It wasn’t possible.
      They asked why,
      ‘It’s called Pepsi Cola,’ said the man.
      We started to drink
      from that death, which shrivels up our skin and makes our blood toothsome.
      Now not even doctors’ water can heal us
    </p>
