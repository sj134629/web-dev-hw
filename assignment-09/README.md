    1. The universal selector is used when you use *. It styles every element on the page.

- I first watched the walkthrough. It took me a bit to watch it because my Wifi was down or just being really slow. I put in my main and meta elements in. Then I created a css folder and a css page. I linked the index and css page together using the link tag. In my index page I put in 4 div tags with headers. I put in a header at the top of page. I used element, class and Id selectors in my css style page to change the colors in my page. In the index page I created tables in each one of my divs with 2 columes each. one colume I put in an image and the other I put in text using the paragraph tag.
