          <td width="500"><p>Fruits Basket is probably my all time favorite anime/manga there is. It is about this girl named Tohru Honda who becomes homeless because her grandfather decided to renovate his house. He asked her if she could live with one of her friends for the time being. She did not want to be a burden to her friends, so she decided to live in a tent. On he way to school she finds this house in the middle of the woods. She finds out that the prince of her school Yuki Sohma lives there with his cousin Shigure Sohma. They find out that Tohru has been living in a tent in the woods and take her in to live with them. She meets Yuki's rival Kyo Sohma. Later on she finds out that if the Sohmas are hugged by the opposite sex they turn into one of the animals from the chinese zodiac. It is a curse that was put on the family a long time ago.</p>
          <p>I guess I just have this weird obsession of the zodiacs. I find them really interesting. This anime/manga is just so sweet and covers the stuggles that the Sohmas have to face due to their curse.</p> </td>

          <p>I like this anime/manga because to be honest I am a sucker for romance. This anime/manga is pretty much a love triangle between humans and vampires. It it pretty much the japanese verion of Twilight, but without werewolves.</p> </td>
