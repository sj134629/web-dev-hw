- an example of text, selection and the button input would be on Facebook where your post your status.
- I watched the walk through and went by it, to figure out what I had to do on the instuctions for the Assignment. I put in my 4 elements and headings. I couldn't figure out how to get the image of the submit button on my page, but I use the Input actions to put a button on my page. I made a table with all the contact information. I use the input acton to put in a text area and my questions.I submited my assignment to the github and submitted my links to the moodle.
