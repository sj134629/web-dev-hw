- My client is a Pop Artist. They wanted a website about them and a way to show off there art. They wanted the color scheme to be similar to the bright colors that are usually in pop art like bright reds, blues, yellows, purples and greens. They wanted their website to be like their art. They wanted it to pop.
- Display
  1. Inline : It takes up horizontal space and it does not force new lines
  2. Intine-block : It takes up horizontal space and forces elements to respect margins and vertical spacing rules.
  3. Block : It can create vertical menu list.
- I spent a long time on this website. I think it took me a whole day create it. Warning, I made a pretty big mess, but I think I got a hang of pseduos and pseduo-classes. I did not get them very well before.

I first made all of my folders and files. I put in my main and meta elements in my index like normal. I copied and pasted them into my other pages like my contact.html, about.html and service.html. I made my menu and drop down menu using my menu stylesheet. I change my colors, spacing and positioning using classes, id, and spans. I linked my pages together using the a tag and copying and pasteing them in to all of my html pages. In my home page (the index) I created a big bannner and a about button that leads to the about page. In my about page I used a table to create a place where my client could put an image of themselves or a self portrait and a discription about themselves. In the Gallery (service.html) I wanted to make an area that just show my clients art and a discription of each work of art. I used a table to do that and spaced it useing my css stylesheet. In the contact page I created a form to make the 3 feedback elements and I wanted to add another image because my client is a very visual person and like images. I put my menu in all of my pages and added social media buttons on it as well.
